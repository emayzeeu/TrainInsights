# Train Insights
This Project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the financial and operational performance of National Rail services. This project leverages ticket sales data to identify popular routes, peak travel times, revenue generation from different ticket types and classes, and diagnose on-time performance along with contributing factors for delays.
